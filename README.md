## Unity Example Projects ##
This repo includes additional Unity projects which demonstrate functionality of the UCA.

These projects have been built and tested with Unity 2019.1.8f on Windows 64-bit.

To use these examples:

1. Launch Unity, select Open Project and open the UnityExamples Project
2. Import the UltrahapticsCoreAsset .unitypackage.

The UnityExamples Project includes the following Example Scenes

- **Bubbles** - demonstrates how to trigger a Sensation when an animated bubble collides with the hand.
- **ButtonAndSlider** - demonstrates how mid-air haptic controls (push button and slider) controlled via the hand, can be enhanced with haptic feedback.
- **HandPolylineDesigner** - demonstrates how to use Polyline to design haptic paths which trace features of the hand.
- **MultiArrayLeftRight/MultiArrayUpDown** - demonstrates a couple of examples for using multiple Ultrahaptics Devices, using the SDK's "Distance-Based" device selection mode.
- **PinchInteraction** - demonstrates a custom Data Source to recognise a basic pinch pose interaction
- **SensationExplorer** - provides a showcase of Sensation-Producing Blocks in your project.
- **SimpleShapes** - demonstrates the ProjectPathOntoPlane Block, to produce simple haptic interaction with Cube, Sphere and Cylinder geometry.
- **Sphere** - demonstrates a Sphere Sensation Block - touch the moon!
- **TouchBlock** - demonstrates how to position and animate a Sensation based on the position of a Cube. 
- **UltrahapticsPoster** - demonstrates how to design an interactive poster. When the hand touches the orb a 'Lightning' haptic is triggered with audio and visuals.
